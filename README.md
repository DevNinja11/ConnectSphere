 ## My Contrubutions

In this Social Media application, I played a crucial role by applying my skills in Java and JavaScript. I focused on developing the back-end using Spring Boot, handling core functionalities such as user authentication, role management, and chat features, all integrated with MySQL for effective data management. For the front-end, I used React to build a user-friendly interface where users can manage friends, photos, and posts. My team members took care of integrating Cloudinary for photo storage and Docker for containerization, ensuring the app ran smoothly and was easy to deploy.
